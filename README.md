#### Chess  
This was a school project for COSC 3P71 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. The goal was to create a single-threaded chess-playing program which used Alpha-Beta pruning to select moves. The program was written in Java. Aside from the initial setup (which uses AWT), the program uses a command line interface. The program can search seven ply in a reasonable amount of time, includes two evaluation functions, and won "Best in Class" for winter 2016.
